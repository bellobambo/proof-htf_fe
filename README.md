# ProofHTF Frontend 🎓
Proof is a learning management platform that brings blockchain education to life. Proof connects students and tutors in a decentralized classroom where courses are created, assessments are taken, and scores are recorded on-chain. ✨

## 🌍 Powered by Lingo.dev Translation
Breaking down language barriers in education! The platform integrates [Lingo.dev](https://lingo.dev/en) to provide real-time text translation, allowing students from around the world to learn in their preferred language. With support for Spanish, French, German, Chinese, and Italian, course content and exam questions can be instantly translated, making quality education truly global. 🗣️

## 🔐 MetaMask Advanced Permissions Integration
Built with **MetaMask Smart Accounts Kit** and **EIP-7702**, Proof implements advanced permission controls that enable seamless, gasless interactions:

- **Automated Tipping System**: Students can grant one-time permissions to tip tutors after completing courses without manual transaction approvals for each tip
- **Streamlined Enrollment**: Course enrollment fees are handled through delegated permissions, removing friction from the onboarding process
- **Gas Abstraction**: Advanced permissions enable the platform to sponsor transactions on behalf of students, making blockchain education accessible without requiring users to manage gas fees
- **Secure Token Management**: Students control spending limits and can revoke permissions at any time through MetaMask's permission management interface

This integration leverages EIP-7702 to provide a Web2-like UX while maintaining the security and transparency of blockchain technology.
