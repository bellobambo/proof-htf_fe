# Proof  🎓
Proof is a learning management platform that brings blockchain education to life. Proof connects students and tutors in a decentralized classroom where courses are created, assessments are taken, and scores are recorded on-chain. ✨

## 🔐 MetaMask Advanced Permissions Integration
Built with **MetaMask Smart Accounts Kit** and **EIP-7702**, Proof implements advanced permission controls that enable seamless, gasless interactions:

- **Automated Tipping System**: Students can grant one-time permissions to tip tutors after completing courses without manual transaction approvals for each tip
- **Streamlined Enrollment**: Course enrollment fees are handled through delegated permissions, removing friction from the onboarding process
- **Gas Abstraction**: Advanced permissions enable the platform to sponsor transactions on behalf of students, making blockchain education accessible without requiring users to manage gas fees
- **Secure Token Management**: Students control spending limits and can revoke permissions at any time through MetaMask's permission management interface
